			<div class="observations">
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.1.18</p>
				<p class="daily_observations">Today the beans arrived home. The first thing to do is to soak them. I let the beans soak in warm water for around 24 hours. They are to be pulled out tomorrow.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.2.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The beans were taken out of the water. They were taken out of the water and placed on a damp paper towel in a Ziploc bag.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.3.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Nothing much to report today, they were in the Ziploc bag for the entire day.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.4.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Nothing much to report today, they were in the Ziploc bag for the entire day.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.5.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Today is the day the beans get removed from the bag. Having germinated, they were planted about one inch deep in potting soil.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.6.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Today the beans were watered and placed out in the sun. I think I over-watered them as the pot looks like a swamp. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.7.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The beans are left out overnight and I have seen no growth since yesterday, not that I expected any.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.8.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">No growth and the pot still is soaked in water even hough I have not re-watered the plans. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.9.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations"> I got a new pot for the plants today. In fact, a new pot for each bean. I feel they will grow much better now that they do not have to fight for resources. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.10.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Still no growth from any of the beans, I'm starting to get worried. I think soon I will move them inside and give one constant light and water.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.11.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">More water and sun today, still no growth.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.12.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The beans are still out in  the sun today, they were also watered. Still no growth to report and I am questioning what I did wrong.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.13.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">More water, more sun, and still no growth. I don't know what is taking so long. Maybe I planted them wrong.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.14.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">More water and sun, still no growth. Now I am almost out of things I could have done wrong. I have no idea why they are not growing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.15.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">I am really getting tired at staring at dirt. Still there is no growth.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.16.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Today is no better. My bean, like always, is at 0 cm. I am getting very worried.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.17.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Today is no different. No bean growth. It is embarrassing to only have a weed growing in the pot.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.18.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">URGHHHHHH. My beans still have not grown. I give them plenty of water and sun but they do not repay the favor.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.19.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Well I'm about done with the lack of growth. Soon one of these plants are coming inside.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.20.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Today I finally got tired of no growth in any of the beans. I moved one pot into the house and put a lamp over it for all 24 hours.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.21.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">That was fast. I already have a 1-2 cm plant. I should have done this earlier.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.22.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The plant is growing fast and growing .5-1 cm leaves. Now the plant is 5-6 cm tall.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.23.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Bean Nye is growing great. Multiple leaves and ~6 cm tall.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.24.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Another day of growth. 4-5 leaves, strong stem, ~7 cm. If this keeps up, Ban Nye will hit the 40 cm mark in no time.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.25.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Growing speed of this plant continues to amaze me. Now Bean Nye is around 8 cm tall and looking healthy.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.26.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Bean Nye is still growing strong. Is is now 8-9 cm. Stem and all other parts look healthy.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.27.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Bean Nye looking good. More leaves and taller (10-11 cm).</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.28.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Now, my plant is super tall (17-20 cm). The leaves are bigger and greener. Looking good for the second to last bean check.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.29.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">2-3 cm of growth overnight. The leaves look bigger, greener, and overall better. Soon I will need to put in a stick of some kind to keep this plant upright.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 3.30.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Bean Nye looks very nice. It has grown and is now 30-35 cm. This upcoming bean check should be a breeze.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.1.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The leaves have grown a ton. As well, the plant is now ~37 cm tall. Sadly, the leaves at the bottom of the plant seem to be dying. I have no idea why, they just are.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.2.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The bottom leaves are definitely dying. I think it is because the bigger leaves about them block the sunlight. Bean Nye is still very close to the 40 cm mark. Can't wait for the check tomorrow.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.3.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Plant check today places Bean Nye at 42 cm. Now it is exempt from future plant checks. I will do my best to continue watering and taking care of it but I doubt it will grow much taller.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.4.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">I tied the top of Bean Nye too tight and killed the top 1-2 cm of my plant. I had to cut it off. Sadly, I don't think I can grow it back.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.5.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Yep, the top part is not growing back. The leaves are starting to lose their  green. I think Bean Nye is slowly dying. I still water it but it does not seem to be helping.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.6.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">I'm starting to get worried because the bottom of my plant looks to be dying. Bean Nye has not grown like normal over the last few days.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.7.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The leaves at the bottom are yellow and drying up. They must be dead by now.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.8.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">Bean Nye is falling off the stick. I feel it is done for. I am still watering my plant but it does not seem to be making much progress.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.9.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">All of the leaves are definitely drooping. The plant feels no need to grow and is stagnant in height.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.10.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">I really have kind of given up on my plant. I measured it and Bean Nye is 40 cm.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.11.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The entire plant seems to be falling over. No matter the amount of sunlight or water. I think this plant is to be abandoned. I can still finish the scrapbook without it.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Date: 4.12.18</p>
				<p  class="daily_observations">The plant is definitely dead. While still green, it does not respond to the stick or grow from the nutrients in the soil plus the water given. This plant is done for.</p>

			<h2 id="title_header">How Bean Nye Was Grown</h2>
			<br>
			<div class="plant_growth_methods_actual">
				<h4>Germination:</h4>
				<p>Following careful research, I found that the best way to germinate my bean seed was through the "Ziploc Method". 
					The plan called for the bean(s) to be put inside a damp paper towel then placed inside a Ziploc for two to three 
					days. Following this process the seeds germinated in no time.</p>
					
				<h3>-----Time To Grow-----</h3><br>
				
				<h4>Soil:</h4><p>Regular Potting Soil</p><br>
				<h4>Container:</h4><p>Large pot followed by five small pots</p><br>
				<h4>Location:</h4><p>Outside then under a lamp</p><br>
				
				<h4>Why?</h4>
				<p>I originally chose to put it outside because I thought 
					the natural sunlight would be beneficial for the plant. 
					When there was no growth, I figured it was because of
					competition for resources so I put all five beans in 
					separate pots. I though I had solved the problem. When 
					there was still no growth I moved one bean plant inside 
					and put it under a lamp for 24  hours. I ignored the rest 
					of the beans and put my sole focus into this one bean. 
					I worked hard to keep this bean watered and under the lamp. 
					The bean started to grow faster than I thought it could. 
					Over just one day, the bean must have grown upwards of three 
					centimeters. I could not believe it. By the time the last bean check-
					before the final-came around, this bean was at 42 centimeters. I thought 
					it could never get there. Sadly, after that bean check the top of Bean 
					Nye died so I was forced to remove it. It has slightly grown back but 
					not quite back to 42cm. My best measurements place it at 40cm.</p>

			<h2 id="title_header">Life Cycle of Bean Nye</h2>
			<br>
			<div class="life_cycle_actual">
				<h4>Germination</h4>
				<p>For the fastest germination, soak the seeds in water for 12-24 hours prior to planting. This opens 
					up the embryo and lets the roots start forming once in dirt.</p>
				<h4>Seedlings</h4>
				<p>The shoots are bent over at first, and begin a process known as phototropism, which is the process 
					during which the stem straightens and grows upward, toward the light. Two small leaves are produced, 
					which continue to increase in size as the root system develops more fully. </p>
				<h4>Maturing Plants</h4>
				<p>Kidney beans take approximately six weeks to mature from seedlings and begin producing 
					flowers. During this period, the root systems mature and anchor into the soil of their 
					permanent growing area, and the plant produces multiple leaves from the main stem.</p>
				<h4>Fruit Production</h4>
				<p>Flowers begin to form once the plant has matured, from the junction of stem and leaves. 
					Once pollinated, the flower withers and dies, revealing a tiny kidney bean pod. </p>
