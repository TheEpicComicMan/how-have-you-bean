			<!-- questions / answers -->
			<ol>
				<li class="question">Why do plants need to exchange gases with the environment?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plants need to exchange gases with the environment because otherwise they 
					would not be able to go through photosynthesis. If plants do not undergo this important process, 
					they will not have the energy needed to survive. Being autotrophs, they do not, and cannot, 
					rely on others as sources of food. A plant's only hope for needed sugars is itself and without
					precious gases like CO2, it cannot survive.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Identify the main gas exchange organs in plants? Explain how this process take place?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">The main gas exchange organ is the leaf. The leaf has stomata. These are pores on the underside of leaves that allow 
					gases to enter the plant. The gases diffuse into the leaves based on what is needed. Carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis which 
					can only happed during the day. Oxygen is needed round the clock for cellular respiration.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Define plant transpiration? What are the two main 
					types of plant transpiration processes? Which of them has a greater volume?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plant transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant. Stomatal transpiration is 
				the most dominant form of transpiration being responsible for most of the water loss in plants. It accounts for 90-95%  
				of the water transpired from leaves. As the name suggests, the process involves the participation of the stomata, 
				microscopic pores in the epidermis of the leaves. Cuticular transpiration is responsible for the loss of water 
				in plants via the cuticle. Water vapor directly diffuses through the cuticle on leaves and escapes to the atmosphere.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Define stomata? How do these structures participate in plant transpiration?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Stomata are small specialized passageways for water and gases 
					present in the epidermis of plants. As the plant needs to lose more or less water and heat, 
					the stomata respectively close or open, preventing or allowing the movement of gases via diffusion. </p>
				
				<li class="question">Identify the elements that compose stomata?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">A stomata is made of a central opening, called the ostiole, 
					or slit, surrounded by two guard cells responsible for closing and opening. 
					A substomatal chamber is located under the ostiole.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Explain how do plants control the opening and the closing of stomata?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plants control the opening and closing of stomata through the swelling and shrinking 
					of guard cells surrounding the pore. When the guard cell swells, it forces the pore closed. When 
					the guard cell shrinks, it allows for the pore to be more open.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Is transpiration the only way through which leaves lose water?  Elaborate.</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plants do not only lose water in the form of vapor, as is the case in transpiration. 
					Leaves also lose liquid water through a phenomenon known as guttation. Guttation takes place through 
					structures called hydathodes, which are similar to stomata. Guttation mainly occurs when transpiration 
					is difficult due to high air humidity or when the plant is placed in watery soil. </p>
				
				<li class="question">How do the volume of water absorption and the 
					volume of water transpiration vary in plants over the course of 
					a day? Overall, how can these quantities be compared?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">During the day, the volume of water transpired is higher 
					than the volume absorbed by the roots. At night, the situation reverses 
					and the roots absorb more water than the volume of water transpired. It 
					can be observed that the volume of water transpired and the volume of 
					water absorbed practically equal over the course of a day. </p>
				
				<li class="question">How do plants solve the problem of transporting substances throughout their tissues?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">The xylem is the structure that carries the nutrients up through the stem. The phloem is the structure responsible
					for bringing items back down the stem. If substances need to move up, they "hitch a ride" on the xylem, if they need to be 
					brought downwards, they are transported by the phloem.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Are xylem and phloem made of living cells? Explain.</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Xylem is made of non-living material while phloem is made of living cells. 
					A large reason for xylem to be made of non-living material is that is must be hollow.</p>
				
				<li class="question">What is root pressure?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Root pressure is the pressure within the cells 
					of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.</p>
				
				<li class="question">What is capillarity? How is this phenomenon chemically 
				explained? What is the relevance of capillarity for water transport in plants?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Capillarity is the phenomenon through which water moves inside 
					extremely thin tubes (capillaries) aided by the attraction force between water 
					molecules and the capillary wall. The phenomenon of capillarity is possible 
					because water is a polar molecule that forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. 
					Therefore, there is an electrical attraction (adhesion force) between the 
					capillary wall and the water molecules, which then pull each other 
					(cohesion force), since they are bound. Other liquids may also move 
					inside capillaries via capillarity, and not just water.</p>
				
				<li class="question">What are plant hormones?  Give examples.</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plant hormones (aka phytohormones) are chemicals 
					that regulate plant growth. They affect which tissues grow 
					upward and which grow downward, leaf formation, stem growth, 
					fruit development and ripening, plant longevity, and even plant 
					death. Examples include: <strong>auxin</strong>, <strong>gibberellins</strong>, 
					<strong>ethylene</strong>, and <strong>cytokinins</strong>.</p>
				
				<li class="question">What is the coleoptile? Why does the removal of the 
					extremity of the coleoptile prohibit plant growth?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">The coleoptile is the first (one or more) aerial structure 
				of the sprouting plant that emerges from the seed. It encloses the young stem 
				and the first leaves, protecting them. The top of the coleoptile is generally 
				the region where auxins are produced. If this region is removed, plant growth 
				stops, since auxins are necessary to promote growth and tissue differentiation.</p>
				
				<li class="question">Define photoperiodism?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Photoperiodism is the response of an organism to seasonal changes in day length.</p>
				
				<li class="question">How are plant tissues classified according to their functions?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">Plant tissues are divided into growth  
					tissues, supporting, filling and photosynthetic tissues, 
					conducting tissues and covering tissues.</p>
				
				<li class="question">What is the vascular cambium? What is its function? </li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">The vascular cambium is the tissue in between the two other types 
					of vascular tissue. It becomes important in secondary growth of plants (growing wider). 
					It separates the phylum and xylem making copies of each for each side of the cambium.</p>
				
				<li class="question">How do the 3 plant systems work together?</li>
				<br>
				<p class="answer">The 3 plant systems (reproductive, vascular, and response) 
					work together to provide the necessary nutrients to reproduce. For example, 
					the vascular and reproductive systems work together when reproductive nutrients 
					like boron are absorbed from the soil by the root system and transported 
					through the xylem until they reach the plants reproductive organs. All of 
					these systems must work together flawlessly in order to ensure another 
					generation of the plant.</p>
